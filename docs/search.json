    "text": "The work presented below was based on the same data sets used in the 2024 assessment. The first task was to update the model runs to include the 2023 data. The model runs were updated and the results are presented below. The model runs were then used to compare the FT-NIR data with the traditional data sources (BTS and ATS). The results of these comparisons are presented below. The model fits to the data are presented in the tables at the end of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Data extent by age composition and model runs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Model results comparing last year’s selected model -2021)",
