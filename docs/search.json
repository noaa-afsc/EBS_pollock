(2024)) since there are many similarities in the type of data available. Namely, empirical weight-at-age, acoustic survey data, and indices of 1-year olds (ref).",

While this model is not yet fully developed, we present preliminary results here. The model is written in TMB and is similar to the WHAM model. We pursue this model to explore the potential for a more flexible model that can be used for more explicit considerations of stocks linked to different regions (e.g., the US and Russian portions of the EBS). Also, this model to add sex-specificity and random effects (Cheng et al. (2025)).",
