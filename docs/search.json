We enhanced the capability of the code to deal with some alternative hypotheses of factors that affect the stock recruitment relationship (SRR). We stepped through a number of sensitivity analyses to evaluate the stock-recruitment relationship (SRR) and the steepness of the SRR. We also evaluated the impact of including the natural mortality-at-age estimates from CEATTLE model.",
