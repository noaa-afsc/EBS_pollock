# CIE model runs 

To be part of the white paper and supplemental analyses

FTNIR folder the start for testing FT-NIR results
  lastyr: no-age error, as in 2024
  lastyrdb: same as last year but with design-based age compositions
  lastyrdbae: same as above but with age-error for TMA
  ftnir1: gear-aggregated age error, all FTNIR data in
  ftnir2: gear-specific age error, all FTNIR data in
  ftnir3: gear-aggregated age error, but excluding acoustic-trawl FTNIR data (set to TMA)
  ftnir4: gear-specific age error, but excluding acoustic-trawl FTNIR data (set to TMA)

last_yr = m23 from the accepted model in 2024


CEATTLE folder is for porting from the GOA pollock example to bridge with single-species mode of EBS pollock
