# Executive Summary

## Summary of Changes in Assessment Inputs

The work presented below was based on the same data sets used in the 2023 assessment. The
model was updated so that it could handle a number of requests from the SSC. We enhanced
the capability of the code to deal with some alternative hypotheses of factors that affect
the stock recruitment relationship (SRR). We stepped through a number of sensitivity
analyses to evaluate the stock-recruitment relationship (SRR) and the steepness of the
SRR. We also evaluated the impact of including the natural mortality-at-age estimates from
CEATTLE model.
