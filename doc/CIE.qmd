# Executive Summary

The work presented below was based on the same data sets used in the 2024 assessment. The
first task was to update the model runs to include the 2023 data. The model runs were
updated and the results are presented below. The model runs were then used to compare the
FT-NIR data with the traditional data sources (BTS and ATS). The results of these
comparisons are presented below. The model fits to the data are presented in the tables at
the end of the document.


# Comparing FT-NIR compositions with traditional microscope age estimations

The fish age and growth lab at the AFSC have endeavored to expand on new technologies
 (@helser2019). 

Examining the abundance-at-age (for design-based estimates of the bottom-trawl age compositions) we show that in general, the TMA estimates show a high level of consistency 
by cohort (@fig-consisTMA). For these same data, when applied to the FTNIRs age-estimation method, the consistency was lower (@fig-consisFTN).

When preparing the data for the assessment, we plotted out the proportions-at-age for the TMA data and noted the differences in the estimates using the FTNIRs age estimates 
(@fig-proportionsFSH, @fig-proportionsBTS, and @fig-proportionsATS). Other preparations involved estimating the age-determination errors for 
each method following that of @punt2008. For the FTNIRs data, we optionally estimated separate age-estimation error 
matrices by gear type. The appearance of the fleet-aggregated and fleet-specific input data files is shown in @fig-dataFile.

# Alternative assessment software

## Stock-synthesis 3
Stock synthesis 3 (SS3) is a well establish framework and is common in many diverse settings.
(@methot2013)
For EBS pollock, we extended an initial framework based on the configurations used for Pacific
hake (@hake2024) since there are many similarities in the type of data available. Namely, empirical
weight-at-age, acoustic survey data, and indices of 1-year olds (ref).

## WHAM
The "Woods Hole Assessment model" (WHAM) is written in TMB and is a fully state-space model
(@stock2021). 

## RTMB model

Work at AFSC has developed a general model which has flexibility to specify regions and a variety of options including random effects. While this model is not yet fully developed, we
present preliminary results here. The model is written in TMB and is similar to the WHAM model. 
We pursue this model to explore the potential for a more flexible model that can be used for
more explicit considerations of stocks linked to different regions (e.g., the US and Russian 
portions of the EBS). Also, this model to add sex-specificity and random 
effects (@cheng2025). 


## CEATTLE model

The CEATTLE model is a new model developed by the AFSC and is written in TMB (@adams2022). The model is
an extension of the ADMB version used for the three-species multi-species model (@jurado2005, @holsman2024).
